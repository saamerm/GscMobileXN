    Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way
    we
    do business and is the responsibility of every employee of Green Shield Canada. As Canada's premier group and
    individual
    benefits specialist, we strive to provide you with the best customer service. The range of products and services we
    offer our groups and benefit plan participants continues to expand and the technology we use continues to change.
    But,
    no matter how our business changes, we are committed to protecting and respecting your right to privacy and
    confidentiality.
    <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h3> Green Shield Canada is committed to the protection of any personal
    information collected by it or in its custody, including any information transferred to a third party to fulfill the
    purposes for which the information was collected.
    <br /> <br /> Personal information includes any information, recorded
    or not, about an identifiable individual. Examples of personal information that are identifiable include names, age,
    sex, social insurance numbers, health status, health history, financial information, benefit claims data, etc. It
    also
    includes information which can be matched with other information in order to establish an individual’s identity.
    <h3>
        GREEN SHIELD CANADA'S PRIVACY CODE
    </h3> The Green Shield Canada privacy code outlines our policies and procedures
    on privacy and describes the ways we ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information
    is
    protected. It is based on the ten privacy principles outlined in Canada’s Personal Information Protection and
    Electronic
    Documents Act also known as PIPEDA. Our adoption of these principles sends a powerful message to the general public
    that
    we have policies and procedures in place that control the collection, use and disclosure of personal information; it
    also reinforces our existing commitment to customer service.
    <br /> <br /> Our privacy code balances the privacy rights
    of our groups and benefit plan participants, and our employees with the legitimate information requirements to
    provide
    customer service and to meet our human resource requirements. It consists of the following key principles: <br />
    <br /><b>We ask for your personal information for the following purposes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>To establish your identification.</li>
        <li>To provide you and/or your dependants with the applicable benefit coverage.</li>
        <li>To protect you and us from error and fraud.</li>
        <li>To provide ongoing access to other services of Green Shield Canada </li>
    </ul>
    <br /><b>Consent</b><br /><br />When you first become a group and benefit plan participant of Green Shield Canada,
    your personal information is obtained and used only with your consent. We obtain your consent before we:
    <ul>
        <li>provide benefit coverage.</li>
        <li>offer you other Green Shield Canada services.</li>
        <li>obtain, use or disclose to other persons, information about you </li>
        <li>use your personal information in any way we did not inform you about previously.</li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br /> Your consent can be either express or implied. Express consent can be verbal or written. For example,
    when you sign an enrollment form you are giving us written consent to use your personal information to provide you
    and/or your dependents with benefits; when you submit a claims form, you are giving us written consent to use your
    personal information to reimburse you for benefit costs that you incur. <br /><br /> Consent can be implied or
    inferred
    from certain actions. For example, if you present your benefit identification card to a pharmacist/dentist in lieu
    of
    paying for a prescription/dental procedure, it can be implied as consent for the pharmacist/dentist to provide your
    personal information to Green Shield Canada to obtain payment for the service rendered, and for Green Shield Canada
    to
    process the related claim for payment and provide other services. <br /> <br />For our existing groups and benefit
    plan
    participants, we will continue to use and disclose your personal information previously collected in accordance with
    our
    current privacy code, unless you inform us otherwise. We will infer that consent has been obtained for the continued
    use
    or disclosure of your personal information by the processing of any existing or future benefit claims that you
    submit
    for reimbursement or access to other services. <br /><br /><b>Withdrawal of consent</b><br /><br />You can withdraw
    your
    consent any time after you've given it to us, provided there are no legal or regulatory requirements to prevent
    this.<br /><br />If you don't consent to certain uses of personal information, or if you withdraw your consent, we
    will
    not be able to administer your benefit coverage. If so, we will explain the situation to you to help you with your
    decision.<br /><br /> <b>Exceptions to consent</b> <br /><br />
    <p>
        We may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent in the following situations:
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                For an emergency that threatens your life, health or security. We will subsequently inform you of this
                disclosure.
                <br />
            </li>

            <li>
                For legal reasons. We may be compelled to release this information by a court of law or other legal or
                regulatory authority. If so, our policy is to disclose the information only to the extent required.
            </li>

            <li>
                To another organization for the purposes of investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of
                the
                laws of Canada or a province that has been, is being, or is about to be committed and it is reasonable
                to
                expect that disclosure with your knowledge or consent would compromise the investigation.
            </li>

            <li>
                To another organization for the purposes of detecting or suppressing fraud or of preventing fraud that
                is
                likely to be committed and it is reasonable to expect that the disclosure with your knowledge or consent
                would compromise the ability to prevent, detect or suppress the fraud.
            </li>

            <li>
                Made to a government institution, a part of a government institution or your next of kin or authorized
                representative and
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are reasonable grounds to believe that you have been, are, or may be the victim of financial
                    abuse,
                </li>

                <li>
                    The disclosure is made solely for the purposes related to preventing or investigating the above, and
                </li>

                <li>
                    It is reasonable to expect that disclosure with your knowledge or consent would compromise the
                    ability
                    to prevent or investigate the abuse.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>
                In accordance with other provisions as provided for in the Personal Information Protection and
                Electronic
                Documents Act.
            </li>
        </ul>

        reasonable time thereafter, or to meet any legal, regulatory, or tax requirements. We have retention standards,

        your
        name from the information.<br /><br /><b>
            You can obtain and verify the accuracy of your personal
            information

        to an outside organization. If a third party has given us personal information which you tell us is wrong, we

        give you the name and address of that party so that you can correct the information.<br /><br /><b>
