		Before using the mobile application, you must create an account in the CCQ’s online services.
		<br />
		<br />
		Your use of the mobile application must comply with the present terms and conditions. 
		<br />
		<br />
		I acknowledge that the Commission de la construction du Québec (CCQ) is the administrator of the complementary social benefits plans (MÉDIC Construction). 
		<br />
		<h3>Claim for benefits</h3>
		As a person insured by MÉDIC Construction, I agree that all information provided in the context of an online claim for benefits for myself or one of my dependents recognized by MÉDIC Construction is complete and accurate. 
		<br />
		<br />I am authorized by my spouse and/or dependents recognized by MÉDIC Construction to disclose and receive information about them that is used for the present purpose. 
		<br />
		<br />For the purpose of administration and evaluation of claims and for fraud prevention, I authorize the CCQ to obtain and disclose personal, medical, psychosocial, and administrative information from a third party, including healthcare facilities and professionals, insurers, plan administrators, and regulatory and law enforcement agencies. I understand that the information will be used and preserved by the CCQ for administration of benefits. 
		<br />
		<br />My dependents understand that this information may be seen by me and will be used by the CCQ for the above-mentioned purposes. 
		<br />
		<h3>Conservation</h3>
		I acknowledge that I am responsible for conserving original receipts for 12 months following the date of submission of the claim for benefits. 
		<br />
		<h3>Verification</h3>
		Any claim for benefits may be subject to verification by the CCQ. When requested by the CCQ, I must produce the original receipt within the following 30 days, by mail or by any technological means authorized by the CCQ. 
		<br />
		<br />If the information I supply is incomplete or inaccurate, I understand that the CCQ reserves the right to withdraw my privilege to make claims for benefits online. 
		<br />
		<br />If I cannot produce the original receipts for the CCQ within the deadline or if I provide false or incomplete information, the CCQ reserves the right to withdraw my privilege to make claims for benefits online as long as I have not transmitted the original receipts or as long as the claim for benefits has not been processed by the CCQ. 
		<br />
		<br />In addition, if I cannot produce the original receipts for the CCQ or if I provide false or incomplete information, the CCQ may reject the claim and may claim back from me, as applicable, the reimbursement of any payment that it has made related to such a claim and consider that it is an excess payment that it may deduct from my subsequent claims for benefits. 
		<br />
		<br />In case of verification, I authorize the exchange of information, as applicable, between the CCQ and the other parties concerned, including, but not limited to, healthcare providers, suppliers of medical equipment, and insurers, and only when said information is necessary for the purpose of administering claims for benefits. 
		<br />
		<h3>Recognized supplier</h3>
		The CCQ uses the national database of suppliers and their affiliation with all regulatory bodies, professional associations, or educational programs established by its authorized agent. When a claim is made for a supplier that is not listed in the national database, the CCQ will first verify whether the supplier holds the necessary operating licences and if it is a member in good standing of a professional order or of an association that it recognizes; following this verification, the claim will be processed if it is in order. 
		<br />
		<h3>Protection and control of your mobile device</h3>
		You are responsible for protecting and controlling your mobile device, your MÉDIC Construction card number, and your username and password. You alone are responsible for taking the appropriate precautions to preserve and protect this information. You are also responsible for any actions taken under your username. It is your responsibility to notify the CCQ immediately of any unauthorized use of your username and password and of any breach of security involving them. 
		<br />
		<br />In addition, the mobile application has a function that enables you to display your MÉDIC Construction card number. The presentation of this identification number to a supplier means that you consent for this supplier to exchange personal information with the CCQ for processing of claims for benefits and any other service necessary for you or your eligible dependents. Unauthorized use of this identification number constitutes fraud.
		<br />
		<h3>Use of the mobile application</h3>
		You alone are responsible for all charges (including roaming charges) invoiced by your wireless service provider or your Internet service provider for use of the mobile application. As a consequence, you cannot claim such charges from the CCQ.
		<br />
		<h3>Intellectual property rights</h3>
		All content in the mobile application, including texts, logos, slogans, drawings, graphics, images, photographs, videos, downloads, technical programs, and business processes, is the exclusive property of the CCQ or is otherwise provided or used under licence by the CCQ. Any unauthorized use of this content, including any reproduction, distribution, transmission, communication, performance, translation, distribution to a third party, or downloading, is prohibited.
		<br />
		<br />Although the CCQ makes every reasonable effort to ensure that the mobile application is free of errors, interruptions, and viruses, it makes no warranties, express or implied, that that the mobile application can be operated without interruptions, errors, or viruses and that the information presented is accurate and error-free.
		<br />
		<h3>Information</h3>
		The CCQ makes every effort possible to ensure that the information available on its website is accurate, complete, and up to date. It must be remembered, however, that the official texts of statutes, regulations, and collective agreements, along with other official documents, take precedence over this information.
		<br />
		<h3>Acceptance</h3>
		The present agreement conditions concerning claims for benefits sent via the Web or by mobile application apply to all claims for benefits. 
		<br />
		<br />By clicking on the "I accept" button, I declare that I have read and understood all the conditions and that I agree to them. 
		<br />
