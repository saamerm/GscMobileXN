        <br />
        The rapid expansion of electronic communication has revolutionized the way we work and provide services to you. 
        At the Alberta Retired Teachers’ Association (“ARTA”), information security is fundamental to the way we do business and 
        is the responsibility of every employee. It is specified in our employment agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.
        <br /><br />
        Whether you choose to access our services online, over the telephone, via our Mobile Application (App), or in person, we 
        follow rigorous security procedures and use state of the art technologies to protect your information and transactions against 
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and misuse.
        <br /><br />
        We design Information Security at ARTA to protect the information, the information systems and communications that deliver 
        the information from harm resulting from failures of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The following are key 
        principles considered in our security processes:<br />
        <ol>
            <li>
                Accountability: Everyone who accesses ARTA information systems is responsible for protecting them and will be held 
                accountable for the use of these systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Awareness: Everyone who accesses ARTA information systems must be aware of the risks and security initiatives.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multidisciplinary: Security must be addressed taking into consideration both technological and non-technological issues.
            </li>
            <li>Integration: Security must be co-ordinated and integrated.</li>
            <li>Reassessment: Security must be reassessed periodically</li>
            <li>Timeliness: Security procedures must provide for monitoring and timely response.</li>
            <li>Societal Factors: Ethics must be promoted by respecting the rights and interests of others.</li>
        </ol><br />While we do our utmost to ensure security and confidentiality, there are steps you can take as well to
        enhance your security when using the Internet and when conducting business online.

            SECURITY IN THE ARTA NETWORK
        </h2>
        <h3>Encryption</h3>
        Many Internet sites are secured through encryption. Encryption encodes the information that flows between your 
        computer or mobile phone and our computer systems protecting it from unauthorized interception, viewing and alteration. 
        <br /><br />
        The transmission of your personal information on ARTA web pages and the Mobile App is secured through encryption. 
        In addition, personal information forwarded to us through the web pages and Mobile App is also secure. 
        <br /><br />
        Our sites will allow only a minimum of 128-bit encryption. Websites have been fully tested and support the two most recent versions of the following browsers:
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Microsoft Explorer</li>
            <li>Google Chrome</li>
            <li>Apple Safari</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Log-on IDs and Passwords</h3>
        Log-on IDs and passwords are used by computer systems and websites to verify your identity. A log-on ID and password 
        allow you to access services and information specific for your private use. Anyone who can access your log-on ID 
        and password can also access your information.

        <br /><br />
        Your password will not be saved and must be re-entered each time you log-on to a secured online service page or the Mobile App.
        <h3>Tips for Creating Unique Passwords</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Do not share your passwords with others, including family members.</li>
            <li>
                Use passwords that are difficult for others to guess. For example, don't use passwords like your name, 
                the names of family members, your address, or any other information that might be found in your purse or wallet if lost or stolen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not use short passwords as these are easier for others to guess. The longer the password, the more difficult 
                you make it for others. Many providers of Internet based services establish standards that define and enforce a 
                minimum length for passwords. ARTA has standards for minimum length of passwords. Our ID and password standards 
                are available through our online help functions on our website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid using the same password for multiple applications or Internet services wherever possible. 
                This is particularly important for any Internet application where access to your private or financial information is enabled.
            </li>
            <li>Change your passwords frequently.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        Cookies are used by ARTA to maintain security during a session on our Website, ensuring that each session 
        is unique and authorized between you and ARTA's web based systems.
        <br /><br />
        ARTA does NOT use cookies for the following purposes: 
        <ol>
            <li>
                To follow the surfing behaviour of visitors once they leave ARTA websites. Additionally, tracking 
                information that may be gathered during a visit to an ARTA website will not be used for promotional purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                For added security, cookies are not used to remember usernames and passwords. You will be required to 
                provide this information each time you log-on to a secured online service page.
            </li>
            <li>
                ARTA does not associate any of the information collected via cookies with your personal or financial information.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Email comments, questions or responses </h3>
        When you send us an email or ask us to respond to you by email, we learn your exact email address and any 
        information you have included in the email. We use your email address to acknowledge your comments and / or 
        reply to your questions, and we will retain your communication and our reply as required under appropriate 
        legal, regulatory and ARTA business practices. We will never send you an email asking for passwords and we 
        will not make your email address available to anyone else.

        <br /><br />
        Email sent or received over the internet may not be secure and we recommend that you use caution when forwarding email messages to us.
        <br /><br />
