		The rapid expansion of electronic communication has revolutionized the way we work and provide services to you. At Wawanesa Life, 
		information security is fundamental to the way we do business and is the responsibility of every
        employee. It is specified in our employment agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.<br /><br />Whether you choose
        to access our services online, over the telephone, via our Mobile Application (App), or in person, we follow rigorous
        security procedures and use state of the art technologies to protect your information and transactions against
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and misuse.<br /><br />We design Information Security at Wawanesa Life
        to protect the information, the information systems and communications that deliver the information from harm resulting
        from failures of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The following are key principles considered in our
        security processes:<br />
        <ol>
            <li>
                Accountability: Everyone who accesses Wawanesa Life information systems is responsible for protecting
                them, and will be held accountable for the use of these systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Awareness: Everyone who accesses Wawanesa Life information system must be aware of the risks and security
                initiatives.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multidisciplinary: Security must be addressed taking into consideration both technological and non-technological
                issues.
            </li>
            <li>Integration: Security must be co-ordinated and integrated.</li>
            <li>Reassessment: Security must be reassessed periodically</li>
            <li>Timeliness: Security procedures must provide for monitoring and timely response.</li>
            <li>Societal Factors: Ethics must be promoted by respecting the rights and interests of others.</li>
        </ol><br />While we do our utmost to ensure security and confidentiality, there are steps you can take as well to
        enhance your security when using the Internet and when conducting business online.

            SECURITY IN THE WAWANESA LIFE NETWORK
        </h2>
        <h3>Encryption</h3>Many Internet sites are secured through encryption. Encryption encodes the information that flows
        between your computer or mobile phone and our computer systems protecting it from unauthorized interception, viewing and
        alteration. You can recognize when you are using a secure website using Internet Explorer as a picture of a lock will
        appear at the bottom of the browser page.
        <br /><br />The transmission of your personal information on Wawanesa Life web pages and Mobile App is secured through encryption. In addition, personal information forwarded to us through
        the web pages and Mobile App is also secure.
        <h3>Log-on IDs and Passwords</h3>Log-on IDs and passwords are used by
        computer systems and websites to verify your identity. A log-on ID and password allow you to access services and
        information specific for your private use. Anyone who can access your log-on ID and password can also access your
        information.
        <br /><br />Your password will not be saved and must be re-entered each time you log-on to a secured online
        service page or the Mobile App.
        <h3>Tips for Creating Unique Passwords</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Do not share your passwords with others, including family members.</li>
            <li>
                Use passwords that are difficult for others to guess. For example, don't use passwords like your name, the names
                of family members, your address, or any other information that might be found in your purse or wallet if lost or
                stolen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not use short passwords as these are easier for others to guess. The longer the password, the more difficult
                you make it for others. Many providers of Internet based services establish standards that define and enforce a
                minimum length for passwords. Wawanesa Life has standards for minimum length of passwords. Our ID and
                password standards are available through our online help functions on our website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid using the same password for multiple applications or Internet services wherever possible. This is
                particularly important for any Internet application where access to your private or financial information is
                enabled.
            </li>
            <li>Change your passwords frequently.</li>
        </ol>

        that each session is unique and authorized between you and Wawanesa Life's web based systems.
        <br /><br />Wawanesa Life does NOT use cookies for the following purposes: <ol>
