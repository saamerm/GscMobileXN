	<p> I acknowledge that the Commission de la construction du Qu&eacute;bec (CCQ) is the organization that administers the complementary social benefits plans (M&Eacute;DIC Construction).<br />
	<p><u>Claim for benefits</u></p>
	As a person insured by M&Eacute;DIC Construction, I agree that all information provided in the context of an online claim for benefits for myself or one of my dependents recognized by M&Eacute;DIC Construction is complete and accurate.<br />
	I understand that the information that I provide to the CCQ will be used for processing of claims and for administration of my benefits, including exchanges of information with third parties for the purpose of management and administration of my benefits plan.<br /> 
	I am authorized by my dependents recognized by M&Eacute;DIC Construction to disclose and receive information about them concerning claims for benefits. My dependents understand that this information will be seen by me and will be used by the CCQ for the purpose of management and administration of my benefits plan.<br /> 
	<p><u> Conservation</u></p>
	I acknowledge that I am responsible for conserving original receipts for 13 months following the date of the claim for benefits. <br />
	<p><u> Verification</u></p>
	Any claim for benefits may be subject to verification by the CCQ. When requested by the CCQ, I must produce the original receipt within the following 30 days, by mail or by any technological means authorized by the CCQ.<br /> 
	If the information I supply is incomplete or inaccurate, I understand that the CCQ reserves the right to withdraw my privilege to make claims for benefits online.<br /> 
	If I cannot produce the original receipts for the CCQ within the deadline or if I provide false or incomplete information, the CCQ reserves the right to withdraw my privilege to make claims for benefits online as long as I have not transmitted the original receipts or as long as the claim for benefits has not been processed by the CCQ. <br />
	In addition, if I cannot produce the original receipts for the CCQ or if I provide false or incomplete information, the CCQ may reject the claim and may claim back from me, as applicable, the reimbursement of the payment made; I acknowledge that the CCQ may deduct any amount that I owe it following the rejection of a claim from my subsequent claims for benefits.<br />
	In case of verification, I authorize the exchange of information, as applicable, between the CCQ and the other parties concerned, including, but not limited to, healthcare providers, suppliers of medical equipment, and insurers, and only when said information is necessary for the purpose of administering claims for benefits. <br /></p>
	<p><u>Recognized supplier</u><br /></p>
	<p>The CCQ uses the national database of suppliers and their affiliation with all regulatory bodies, professional associations, or educational programs established by its authorized agent. When a claim is made for a supplier that is not listed in the national database, the CCQ will first verify whether the supplier holds the necessary operating licences and if it is a member in good standing of a recognized association or a professional order; following this verification, the claim will be processed if it is in order.<br />
	Acceptance The present agreement conditions concerning claims for benefits sent via the Web or by mobile application apply to all claims for benefits. <br />
	By clicking on the &ldquo;I accept&rdquo; button, I declare that I have read and understood all the conditions and that I agree to them. </p>
