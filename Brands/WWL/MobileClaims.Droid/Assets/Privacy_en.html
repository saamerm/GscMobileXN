It is possible that the third parties that we transfer your personal information to may be located in jurisdictions that do not have laws offering the same level of protection as your jurisdiction. However, regardless of the location of the third party, we will put measures in place to protect your Personal Information, including agreements which hold the third parties to standards of confidentiality and security concerning your Personal Information that are similar to the standards that we adhere to.

                    <p>Our retention periods for Personal Information are based on our business needs and legal requirements. We retain Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) that we collected it for, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such information. When Personal Information is no longer needed, we either anonymise it or destroy it.</p>
