        The Commission de la construction du Québec (CCQ) is governed by the Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information.
        <br />
        <br />
				The Regulation Respecting the Distribution of Information and the Protection of Personal Information (CQLR, chap. A-2.1, r.2) obliges all public bodies, including the CCQ, to distribute certain documents and information on their websites. This obligation falls within the commitment of the Government of Québec to offer greater transparency to citizens. You will find on the CCQ’s website documents distributed to meet this obligation. They have been placed with documents of a similar nature already published or associated with information already distributed on themes addressed by these documents.
				<br />
				<br />
				You may consult the documents specific to the Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information and its regulations in the section "Documents and Information Distributed," where they are grouped by theme.
				<br />
				<br />
				The Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information (CQLR, chap. A-2.1) grants you the right to access documents held by our organization. Here is how to make your request and who to address it to.

				<br />Protection of this information is a priority for our organization, and we use numerous means to achieve this. The following internal directive is one example: Communication de renseignements confidentiels en vue d'assurer la protection des personnes (in French only).
