    Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way 
    we do business and is the responsibility of every employee of the Alberta Retired Teachers’ Association (“ARTA”). 
    The range of products and services we offer our Retiree Benefits Plan participants continues to expand and the technology 
    we use continues to change. But, no matter how our business changes, we are committed to protecting and respecting your 
    right to privacy and confidentiality. 


    <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h3> 
    ARTA is committed to the protection of any personal information collected by it or in its custody, including any 
    information transferred to a third party to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected.
    <br /> <br /> 
    Personal information includes any information, recorded or not, about an identifiable individual. Examples of 
    personal information that are identifiable include names, age, gender, social insurance numbers, health status, 
    health history, financial information, benefit claims data, etc. It also includes information which can be 
    matched with other information in order to establish an individual’s identity. 

    <h3>
        ARTA'S PRIVACY CODE
    </h3> 
    The ARTA privacy code outlines our policies and procedures on privacy and describes the ways we ensure that your privacy 
    and the confidentiality of your personal information is protected. It is based on the ten privacy principles outlined in 
    Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act also known as PIPEDA. Our adoption of these principles 
    sends a powerful message to the general public that we have policies and procedures in place that control the collection, 
    use and disclosure of personal information; it also reinforces our existing commitment to customer service.

    <br /> <br /> Our privacy code balances the privacy rights
    of our groups and benefit plan participants, and our employees with the legitimate information requirements to
    provide customer service and to meet our human resource requirements. It consists of the following key principles: 
    Our privacy code balances the privacy rights of our groups and benefit plan participants, and our employees with the legitimate 
    information requirements to provide customer service and to meet our human resource requirements. It consists of the following key principles:

    <br />
    <br /><b>We ask for your personal information for the following purposes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>To establish your identification.</li>
        <li>To provide you and/or your dependants with the applicable benefit coverage.</li>
        <li>To protect you and us from error and fraud.</li>
        <li>To provide ongoing access to other services of ARTA </li>
    </ul>
    <br /><b>Consent</b><br /><br />
    When you first become a group and benefit plan participant of ARTA, your personal information is obtained and 
    used only with your consent. We obtain your consent before we: 
    <ul>
        <li>provide benefit coverage.</li>
        <li>offer you other Green Shield Canada services.</li>
        <li>obtain, use or disclose to other persons, information about you </li>
        <li>use your personal information in any way we did not inform you about previously.</li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br /> 
    Your consent can be either express or implied. Express consent can be verbal or written. For example, when you sign 
    an enrolment form you are giving us written consent to use your personal information to provide you and/or your 
    dependents with benefits; when you submit a claims form, you are giving us written consent to use your personal 
    information to reimburse you for benefit costs that you incur.

    <br /><br />
    Consent can be implied or inferred from certain actions. For example, if you present your benefit identification card 
    to a pharmacist/dentist in lieu of paying for a prescription/dental procedure, it can be implied as consent for the 
    pharmacist/dentist to provide your personal information to ARTA to obtain payment for the service rendered, and for 
    ARTA to process the related claim for payment and provide other services.

    <br /> <br />
    For our existing Retiree Benefits Plan participants, we will continue to use and disclose your personal information 
    previously collected in accordance with our current privacy code, unless you inform us in writing otherwise. We will 
    assume that consent has been obtained for the continued use or disclosure of your personal information by the processing 
    of any existing or future benefit claims that you submit for reimbursement or access to other services.

    <br /><br /><b>Withdrawal of consent</b><br /><br />
    You can withdraw your consent any time after you've given it to us, provided there are no legal or regulatory requirements to prevent this.
    <br /><br />
    If you don't consent to certain uses of personal information, or if you withdraw your consent, we will not be able to administer 
    your benefit coverage. If so, we will explain the situation to you to help you with your decision.

    <br /><br /> <b>Exceptions to consent</b> <br /><br />
    <p>
        We may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent in the following situations:
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                For an emergency that threatens your life, health or security. We will subsequently inform you of this
                disclosure.
                <br />
            </li>

            <li>
                For legal reasons. We may be compelled to release this information by a court of law or other legal or
                regulatory authority. If so, our policy is to disclose the information only to the extent required.
            </li>

            <li>
                To another organization for the purposes of investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of
                the
                laws of Canada or a province that has been, is being, or is about to be committed and it is reasonable
                to
                expect that disclosure with your knowledge or consent would compromise the investigation.
            </li>

            <li>
                To another organization for the purposes of detecting or suppressing fraud or of preventing fraud that
                is
                likely to be committed and it is reasonable to expect that the disclosure with your knowledge or consent
                would compromise the ability to prevent, detect or suppress the fraud.
            </li>

            <li>
                Made to a government institution, a part of a government institution or your next of kin or authorized
                representative and
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are reasonable grounds to believe that you have been, are, or may be the victim of financial
                    abuse,
                </li>

                <li>
                    The disclosure is made solely for the purposes related to preventing or investigating the above, and
                </li>

                <li>
                    It is reasonable to expect that disclosure with your knowledge or consent would compromise the
                    ability
                    to prevent or investigate the abuse.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>
                In accordance with other provisions as provided for in the Personal Information 
                Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada) or the Personal Information Protection Act (Alberta).
