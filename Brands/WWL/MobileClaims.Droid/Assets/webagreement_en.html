        Terms and Conditions

    <p>
        If you accept and agree to the following Terms and Conditions, then click the "Accept" button to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the plan member, I agree that all information provided using the Plan Member Claims or mobile app web claim submission will be complete and accurate.
    </p>
    <p>In the event that my information is found to be incomplete or inaccurate, I understand that Wawanesa Life reserves the right to remove my online claiming privileges. I understand that the information, including the personal information, that I provide to Wawanesa Life about myself and my dependents, will be used by Wawanesa Life for claims adjudication and any other services necessary in the administration of my benefits which may include the exchange of information with other parties to administer my benefit plan.</p>
    <p>I am authorized by my spouse and/or dependents to disclose and receive information about them that is used for these purposes. My spouse and/or dependents understand that this information may be seen by me, the cardholder and used by Wawanesa Life and the other parties referenced in this agreement for the purposes set out in this agreement.</p>
        <p>I understand and agree that I am responsible for retaining original receipt(s) for 13 months following the date of my claim submission(s). When submitting claims online, Wawanesa Life may select my claim for audit. If so requested, I am responsible for producing the original receipt(s) within 30 days.</p>
        <p>I understand that when my claim is selected for an audit, this may result in some or all previous claims submitted on my behalf being selected for a full audit review. When selected for a full audit review, my ability to submit claims through Plan Member Online Services and the app will be temporarily disabled.</p>
        <p>If I fail to provide the receipt(s) to Wawanesa Life, or provide false, incomplete, or misleading information, Wawanesa Life reserves the right to classify any payment made by Wawanesa Life related to my claim as an overpayment and Wawanesa Life will be entitled to demand remittance of payment and/or the deduction of such overpayment from any future claim payments. Furthermore, access to Plan Member Claims and mobile app claims submission will be revoked and coverage to benefits may be suspended and/or terminated.</p>
        <p>If selected for audit, I authorize the exchange of information between Wawanesa Life and other parties, including but not limited to health practitioners, medical device providers and insurers, as required, and only when the information is needed to administer benefit claims and/or confirm the accuracy of the claim(s) information submitted on behalf of myself, my spouse and/or my dependents.</p>
        <p>In the event of suspected fraudulent activity pertaining to a Plan Member Claims or mobile app web claim submission on behalf of myself, my spouse, and/or my dependents, I acknowledge and agree to the disclosure of this information to relevant parties, including but not limited to the Plan Sponsor, and regulatory and law enforcement agencies.</p>
        <p>Wawanesa Life maintains a national database of providers and their association with any regulatory agency, professional association or educational program. Wawanesa Life reviews each provider to determine which benefits/services are eligible for reimbursement in conjunction with the plan member's health benefits plan. When submitting a claim online with a provider that has not registered with Wawanesa Life, the provider's credentials will be verified and my claim will be processed accordingly.</p>
        <p>Acceptance of the Web Claim Submission Agreement Terms and Conditions applies to all claims submitted within an online session.</p>
        <p>If I submit multiple claims (for a different dependent and/or provider) within the online session, my acceptance of the Web Claim Submission Agreement Terms and Conditions applies to all those claims submitted.</p>
        <p>By clicking the "Accept" button, this constitutes my digital signature (which is equivalent to a written signature) and I acknowledge that I am deemed to have read, understood, accepted and agreed to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>I understand that my consent remains valid and can be withdrawn by me at any time. By failing to provide my consent for the use of my personal information, or by withdrawing my consent, I understand that I cannot be registered and cannot participate in the electronic claim process.</p>
