<p><b style="font-size:{FONT_SIZE};color:{TEXT_COLOR};"> We need your consent (read and click “Accept” below)</b></p>

<p>In order to fully operate the Change4Life health rewards portal and to provide the best possible experience, certain information about you will need to be transferred from GSC to the Change4Life portal (offered by GSC through Cookson James Loyalty, Inc.) and we need you to consent to that transfer and the uses of your information set out below. Such information includes personal identifiable, confidential information like your email address and date of birth.</p>

<p>In addition, the Change4Life Web portal will collect information that you enter into it – as much or as little as you are willing to share – and may use it for the following purposes:</p>

<p>•	to offer you targeted education, tools and communications related to your health (only if you consent to receiving such information) </p>
<p>•	to provide you with more effective customer service (eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information) </p>
<p>•	to perform research and analysis aimed at improving our ability to provide high quality health management products, services and technologies to our plan members </p>
<p>•	to provide anonymous data to plan sponsors regarding the overall health status of their collective plan members  </p>
<p>•	clinical research, market research, education and other related research projects, on an anonymous basis only </p>
<p>•	Change4Life health reward redemption (shipping information may be shared with fulfillment providers where necessary) </p>

<p>Your privacy and confidentiality are protected. Personal information will be collected, used and disclosed in compliance with applicable Federal and Provincial privacy legislation including but not limited to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). This means that GSC will limit the transfer, collection and use of personal information to only the relevant and necessary information required to provide the identified service. In the event that your plan is no longer administered by GSC, your personal information will automatically be rendered anonymous. Read more about GSC’s <a href="file:///android_asset/Privacy_en.html"><b>privacy</b></a> , <a href="file:///android_asset/Legal_en.html"><b>legal</b></a> and  <a href="file:///android_asset/Security_en.html"><b>security </b></a> information. </p>

<p><b style="font-size:{FONT_SIZE};color:{TEXT_COLOR};"> Withdrawing your consent</b></p>

<p>Your consent to these conditions can be withdrawn by you at any time (but you will no longer have access to the Change4Life portal, to collect points for doing healthy things and redeeming those points for cool rewards). Should you wish to withdraw your consent in the future (which we hope you don’t), please click on the “Contact Us” link on the Online Services menu and send us a secure e-mail with your request. No further information will be collected and all of your information stored in the Change4Life portal will be rendered anonymous. </p>

<p>The good news is you can rejoin the site at any time in future. (You’ll just have to review this page and click “Accept” again!) Plus, withdrawing your consent for your personal information to be used by the Change4Life portal will not affect the ability for GSC to process your benefit claims.</p>

 <p><b style="font-size:{FONT_SIZE};color:{TEXT_COLOR};"> Change4Life Member Acknowledgement and Consent (this is it…you are almost done)</b></p>
<p>By clicking the “Accept” link below, I consent to the collection, use and disclosure of my personal information as described, and in accordance with the GSC’s Privacy Policy (which I have had an opportunity to review), and acknowledge and agree with all of the above information. </p>
