"privacyContent1"="Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way we do business and is the responsibility of every employee of {0}. As Canada's premier group and individual benefits specialist, we strive to provide you with the best customer service. The range of products and services we offer our groups and benefit plan participants continues to expand and the technology we use continues to change. But, no matter how our business changes, we are committed to protecting and respecting your right to privacy and confidentiality. <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h3> {0} is committed to the protection of any personal information collected by it or in its custody, including any information transferred to a third party to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected. <br/> <br/> Personal information includes any information, recorded or not, about an identifiable individual. Examples of personal information that are identifiable include names, age, sex, social insurance numbers, health status, health history, financial information, benefit claims data, etc. It also includes information which can be matched with other information in order to establish an individual’s identity.";
"privacyContent2"="<h3>{0}'S PRIVACY CODE </h3> The {0} privacy code outlines our policies and procedures on privacy and describes the ways we ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information is protected. It is based on the ten privacy principles outlined in Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act also known as PIPEDA. Our adoption of these principles sends a powerful message to the general public that we have policies and procedures in place that control the collection, use and disclosure of personal information; it also reinforces our existing commitment to customer service. <br/> <br/> Our privacy code balances the privacy rights of our groups and benefit plan participants, and our employees with the legitimate information requirements to provide customer service and to meet our human resource requirements. It consists of the following key principles: <br/> <br/>";
"privacyContent3"="<b>We ask for your personal information for the following purposes:</b> <ul><li>To establish your identification.</li><li>To provide you and/or your dependants with the applicable benefit coverage.</li><li>To protect you and us from error and fraud.</li><li>To provide ongoing access to other services of {0} </li></ul><br/><b>Consent</b><br/><br/>When you first become a group and benefit plan participant of {0}, your personal information is obtained and used only with your consent. We obtain your consent before we:";
"privacyContent4"="<ul><li>provide benefit coverage.</li><li>offer you other {0} services.</li><li>obtain, use or disclose to other persons, information about you </li><li>use your personal information in any way we did not inform you about previously.</li></ul><br/><br/> Your consent can be either express or implied. Express consent can be verbal or written. For example, when you sign an enrollment form you are giving us written consent to use your personal information to provide you and/or your dependents with benefits; when you submit a claims form, you are giving us written consent to use your personal information to reimburse you for benefit costs that you incur. <br/><br/> Consent can be implied or inferred from certain actions. For example, if you present your benefit identification card to a pharmacist/dentist in lieu of paying for a prescription/dental procedure, it can be implied as consent for the pharmacist/dentist to provide your personal information to {0} to obtain payment for the service rendered, and for {0} to process the related claim for payment and provide other services. <br/> <br/>For our existing groups and benefit plan participants, we will continue to use and disclose your personal information previously collected in accordance with our current privacy code, unless you inform us otherwise. We will infer that consent has been obtained for the continued use or disclosure of your personal information by the processing of any existing or future benefit claims that you submit for reimbursement or access to other services. <br/><br/>";
"privacyContent5"="<b>Withdrawal of consent</b><br/><br/>You can withdraw your consent any time after you've given it to us, provided there are no legal or regulatory requirements to prevent this.<br/><br/>If you don't consent to certain uses of personal information, or if you withdraw your consent, we will not be able to administer your benefit coverage. If so, we will explain the situation to you to help you with your decision.<br/><br/> <b>Exceptions to consent</b> <br/><br/>         <p>
            We may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent in the following situations:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>For an emergency that threatens your life, health or security. We will subsequently inform you of this disclosure. <br /></li>

                <li>For legal reasons. We may be compelled to release this information by a court of law or other legal or regulatory authority.  If so, our policy is to disclose the information only to the extent required. </li>

                <li>To another organization for the purposes of investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province that has been, is being, or is about to be committed and it is reasonable to expect that disclosure with your knowledge or consent would compromise the investigation. </li>

                <li>To another organization for the purposes of detecting or suppressing fraud or of preventing fraud that is likely to be committed and it is reasonable to expect that the disclosure with your knowledge or consent would compromise the ability to prevent, detect or suppress the fraud. </li>

                <li>Made to a government institution, a part of a government institution or your next of kin or authorized representative and </li>
                <ul>

"securityContent2"="<h2>SECURITY IN THE {0} NETWORK</h2><h3>Encryption</h3>Many Internet sites are secured through encryption. Encryption encodes the information that flows between your computer or mobile phone and our computer systems protecting it from unauthorized interception, viewing and alteration.

For example, don't use passwords like your name, the names of family members, your address, or any other information that might be found in your purse or wallet if lost or stolen.</li><li>Do not use short passwords as these are easier for others to guess. The longer the password, the more difficult you make it for others. Many providers of Internet based services establish standards that define and enforce a minimum length for passwords. {0} has standards for minimum length of passwords. Our ID and password standards are available through our online help functions on our website.</li><li>Avoid using the same password for multiple applications or Internet services wherever possible. This is particularly important for any Internet application where access to your private or financial information is enabled.</li><li>Change your passwords frequently.</li></ol>";
