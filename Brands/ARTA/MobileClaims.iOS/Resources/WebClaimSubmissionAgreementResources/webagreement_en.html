        <b>Terms and Conditions of this Agreement</b><br /><br />

        If you accept and agree to the following Terms and Conditions, then click the “Accept” button to continue.
        <br /><br />
        As the plan member, I agree that all information provided using the Retiree Benefits Plan Member Online Services or mobile app web claim submission will be complete and accurate.
        <br /><br />
        In the event that my information is found to be incomplete or inaccurate, I understand that ARTA reserves the right to remove my online claiming privileges. I understand that the information, including the personal information, that I provide to ARTA about myself, my spouse and my or our dependents, will be used by ARTA for claims adjudication and any other services necessary in the administration of my benefits which may include the exchange of information with other parties as necessary to administer my benefit plan.
        <br /><br />
        I am authorized by my spouse and/or dependents to disclose and receive information about them that is used for these purposes. My spouse and/or dependents understand that this information may be seen by me, the cardholder and used by ARTA and the other parties referenced in this agreement for the purposes set out in this agreement.
        <br /><br />
        I understand and agree that I am responsible for retaining original receipt(s) for 13 months following the date of a  claim submission(s) by me. When submitting claims online, ARTA may select my claim for audit. If so requested, I am responsible for producing the original receipt(s) within 30 days.
        <br /><br />
        I understand that when a claim submitted by me is selected for an audit, this may result in some or all previous claims submitted on my behalf being selected for a full audit review. When selected for a full audit review, my ability to submit claims through Plan Member Online Services and the app will be temporarily disabled.
        <br /><br />
        If I fail to provide the receipt(s) to ARTA, or provide false, incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information, ARTA reserves the right to classify any payment made by ARTA related to that claim as an overpayment and ARTA will be entitled to demand remittance from me of the overpayment and/or the deduction of such overpayment from any future claim payments. Furthermore, access to Plan Member Online Services and mobile app claims submission will be revoked and coverage to benefits for me, my spouse and my or our dependents  may be suspended and/or terminated.
        <br /><br />
        If selected for audit, I authorize the exchange of information between ARTA and other parties, including but not limited to health practitioners, medical device providers and insurers, as required, and only when the information is needed to administer benefit claims and/or confirm the accuracy of the claim(s) information submitted on behalf of myself, my spouse and/or my or our dependents.
        <br /><br />
        In the event of suspected fraudulent act or omission that relates to claims submitted by me or on behalf of my spouse and or dependents relating  to a Retiree Benefits Plan Member Online Services or mobile app web claim submission by me , I acknowledge and agree to the disclosure of this information to relevant parties as determined by ARTA or other parties referred to above, including but not limited to the Plan Sponsor, regulatory or law enforcement agencies.
        <br /><br />
        ARTA’s claims adjudicator, HBM+, maintains a national database of providers and their association with any regulatory agency, professional association or educational program. HBM+ reviews each provider to determine which benefits/services are eligible for reimbursement in conjunction with the plan member's health benefits plan. When submitting a claim online with a provider that has not registered with HBM+, the provider's credentials will be verified and my claim will be processed accordingly.
        <br /><br />
        Acceptance of the Web Claim Submission Agreement Terms and Conditions applies to all claims submitted within an online session.
        <br /><br />
        If I submit multiple claims (for my spouse or a different dependent and/or provider) within the online session, my acceptance of the Web Claim Submission Agreement Terms and Conditions applies to all those claims submitted.
        <br /><br />
        By clicking the "Accept" button, this constitutes my digital signature (which I agree is equivalent to a written signature) and I acknowledge that I am deemed to have read, understood, accepted and agreed to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.
