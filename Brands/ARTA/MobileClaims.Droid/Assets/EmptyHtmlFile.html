</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    2. If your benefit plan includes Online Claims Submission, this App will provide a feature for submitting claims. When you submit claims using the GSC
    Mobile App Online Claim Submission feature, you agree to the following: “I agree that all information provided using Online claim submission will be
    complete and accurate. In the event that my information is found to be incomplete or inaccurate, I understand that GSC reserves the right to remove my
    online claiming privileges. I understand that the information, including the personal information, that I provide to Green Shield Canada about myself and
    my dependents, will be used by GSC for claims adjudication and any other services necessary in the administration of my benefits which may include the
    exchange of information with other parties to administer this benefit plan.
</p>
<p>
    I am authorized by my spouse and/or dependents to disclose and receive information about them that is used for these purposes. My spouse and/or dependents
    understand that this information may be seen by me, the cardholder and used by GSC and the other parties referenced in this agreement for the purposes set
    out in this agreement.
</p>
<p>
    When submitting claims online, GSC may select my claim for audit. If so requested, I am responsible for producing the original receipt(s) within 30 days.
</p>
<p>
    If I fail to provide the receipt(s) to GSC, or provide false, incomplete, or misleading information, GSC reserves the right to classify my claim as an
    overpayment and will deduct such monies from any future claim payments. Furthermore, my coverage may be denied or terminated and/or online submission may
    be revoked.
</p>
<p>
    I understand and agree that I am responsible for retaining original receipt(s) for 13 months following the date of my claim submission(s).
</p>
<p>
    GSC maintains a national database of providers and their association with any regulatory agency, professional association or educational program. GSC
    reviews each provider to determine which benefits/services are eligible for reimbursement in conjunction with the plan member’s health benefits plan. When
    submitting a claim online, with a provider that has not registered with GSC, the provider’s credentials will be verified and my claim will be processed
    accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    Acceptance of the Online Claim Submission Agreement Terms and Conditions applies to all claims submitted within an online session.
</p>
<p>
    If I submit multiple claims (for a different dependent and/or provider) within the online session, my acceptance of the Online Claim Submission Agreement
    Terms and Conditions applies to all those claims submitted.”
